title unrelated... or is it?

TRAIN OF THOUGHT A?
EXHIBIT A
[20:57] <Eldrick> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(building) first picture.
[20:57] <Eldrick> could be upstate newyork... all the way over to /chicago./
[20:58] <Eldrick> down south out of "north eastern"
[20:59] * ChibiUnunnilium nods ``;
[21:01] <Eldrick> and this one for "you're doing it again" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(building) the triple on the right side of the page.
/EXHIBIT A

[20:12] <Eldrick> 'picture taken at worst time of year outside of rampant snowfall' check 'no leaves to remotely identify where in geographic region the picture is from.' check 'this may not be 20 questiosn but I bet it's in the north eastern us.' ding ding ding.
[20:16] <Eldrick> what went through my head on the duplex entry. I flashed through Fallout 4 for a sec, recognizing the /vague/ style, then recollections of the AB trip. and was all set to 'oh hey the greater boston metropolitan area and fun complex' then I read the /pensylvania/ caption.
[20:16] <Eldrick> then I looked back. the hell were the specifc clues @.@
[20:16] <Eldrick> and then I decided to snark about it.

[20:30] <Eldrick> "A triple-decker in New England." please be more specific @.@ you'redoingitagainwikipedia

exhibit b-1
[20:43] <ChibiUnunnilium> ``;
[20:43] <Eldrick> which part?
[20:45] <Eldrick> I can explain why I get snarky about /vague/ areas like that -that often talk of their very specific charm... and then you look at a picture and can't figure out what country on earth it is in... because some financial demographics look too similar depending on where you're looking.
/exhibit b-1

TRAIN OF THOUGHT B
exhibit b-2
amish country has a certain look. "middle class america" has a certain look... that's repeated in some similar demographics in other countries. if you didn't have the rolling hills in one area you'd think you were not there.
/exhibit b-2

[20:21] * Eldrick was about to say "if it was say Amih/mennonite country that would be one thing... but then mentally seque/segwayed/theyseemerollingmemgoeshere into wondering if google vans should /work/ in amish/mennonite communities. or if they should be divinely attuned clockstoppers... like how some parts of the world are still in black and white due to either tyranny, documentary vision, or both.
[20:22] <Eldrick> I mean you take a 4k /red/ camera into the area andf end up with 35mm/70mm film grain even hairs in the shot. how it's a digital camera.
[20:24] <Eldrick> and that really really thiswasonlymadeforab&w tv gray scale that sometimes tricks the eye into a hint of color that filming for black and white editing just doesn't nab *cough*Pleasantville*cough*
[20:24] <Eldrick> there should be no spaces after "really really" that's all one word, cause it's a sensation `-`v

exhibit b-3
parts of texas. right now -even parts of houston- look like oregon, or wyoming... or mexico. or georgia state... the list goes on. so if you didn't have a caption... everyone assumes it is down the road. in that neighborhood you only bus/drive through but never stop.
/exhibit b-3

TRAIN OF THOUGHT C
exhibit c
[20:46] <Eldrick> the clockstopper thing `-`? [why yes I can't get genius the inventing (can't recall the subheader) out of my head almost a decade later.]
/exhibit c

Genius the Invention... great take on geniuses warping reality by just being cool and inventing. clockstoppers being super luddites who stop all these great works just by being there.

example. if you can get passed the naked blue man dong in Rorshach's movie... you see Doctor Manhattans's assembly. Imagine a derp walking through and it all crashes down just by being nearby... and being a derpy tool.


I would explain North oea looking dismal in photos... but K looks dismal in photos. Coedians make jokes that it can only appear in black and white because of the tyranny and or poverty.


phrases as sensations so you can convey the whole of a thought feeling and deed to another is something I wish humans had. no real trains or exhibits here either.


TRAIN OF THOUGHT D
for deep sea tentacles.
a device is wrappd on my leg that feels gargantuan due to neuropathy and the fact it is on the verge or border of where I can't feel much and can feel normally. "he blackest black and the whitest white are on the border of each other to perception" <-=--- eye science.

I have been having all kinds of need to escape nightmamres... I an't take this thing off ever.

deep. sea. monsters... pulling at my leg. :X

started talking about basements... then basements as dungeons... so the Joy center of my brain piped in... then started fanfictioning.


I'll save that for part 2.
