manslayer's oblivion videos... those ladies actively going back to their kitchens... they seem suspicious. and dangerous. `-`;

[21:18] <Eldrick> Don Tchaknow (pre-Ellis Island Tcaknov) was an early 20th century poet, playwright, and shark wrangler.
[21:21] <Eldrick> after his theater troupe was legally disbanded he fought many legal battles and when in the end he won the day he retired from the whole business {theater} on a yacht costeaux style freeing various animals mfrom the jaws of ocean predators -long before it became /fashionable/ to do so when Orville Proudstone took up the mantle later.
[21:23] <Eldrick> Said of the predator business... "It was less dangerous than dealing with the lawyers let me tell you. A shark wants you dead for stealing it's food. A lawyer makes you wish you were dead for wanting to survive flourish and eat your own food, bought with coins that are not yet theirs."

[21:24] <Eldrick> OhProudstone made it fashionable by skipping the years fine tuning your survival skills by fighting lawyers first. `-`v
[21:25] <Eldrick> yes. *sip* Oh Proudstone. a nickname because saying "Orville" made people think popping corn or powered flight. usually at the same time `-`
[21:27] <Eldrick> so Orville regularly signed everything O. Proudstone. until people started assuming that was his name to announce. "Lady and Lord Penywyrth of Gibralter. Oh Proudstone of Freehold..."

[21:30] <Eldrick> <Joy-chan> Lady Penywyrth is modern society's source for the modern spy... that was then adronified?patronized? @.@ whatever. She trained men to be black ravens to seduce women of power into spilling secrets in exchange for harems of dangerous men. men eventually started getting flirted with, and the bi ones decided to hide it in plain sight creating red sparrows and black widows. Peopel forget Lady P's contributions...
[21:31] <Eldrick> <Joy-chan> Perhaps because she wanted them forgotten `-`
[21:33] <Eldrick> [okay where'd that come from you ask?well when I hear people willingly say things like "honey back to the kitchen!" "f course dear." DANGE$R DUDE SHE IS PLOTTING! and you'll never know because you're a bumbling idiot! run save yourself the second she closes the door. change your name and live in obscurity! anyone who willingly goes "to the kitchen" on rebuke means your death!!!]
[21:33] <ChibiUnunnilium> Okay X3
[21:33] <ChibiUnunnilium> X3 X3 X3
[21:34] <Eldrick> ["Women. Girls. Back to our kitchens." they're plotting run!!!] {manslayer makes funny crazy videos}
[21:35] <Eldrick> [and that dude who joined them? she's not sleeping around that's her %&#&^@ assassin run!!!!!]
[21:35] <Eldrick> `-`
[21:35] <Eldrick> so how is everyone else?

{I was trying to let my brain slow down... but the juices flowing to try to think of how to get out of all this tape... would not stop. :X}

[21:35] <Eldrick> `-`
[21:38] <Eldrick> [[then after they've run off to live in obscurity... one less weirdo hung up on something he saw on the flintstones or something weirder @.@]]
[21:42] <ChibiUnunnilium> I'm okay X3
[21:44] <Eldrick> [[[[[[[[[[[[*lots of'em @.@*  apparently Oh. Proudstone might be from here... it all fits! *illuminati theme* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold,_Greater_Manchester]]]]]]]]]]]]


Flintstones -and humans in general- I was getting at roles yeah... but more how flintstones and jetsons... if you don't understand what's up... just looks like era garbage. "jane would have trouble at his [george's] job. hurr hurr..." and george'd have trouble running a house... likely setting the place on fire. the flintstoens and jetsons show also that both can learn and adapt. it's just effort.

No one sees the effort. Ye a problem in general -men typically think running a house is a breeze... til they try o.X

Another example.

Bob is a gangster... he wants better for his kids. they see wealth and power. they don't know or care about the body count. they'll do the same in less than bob did. hijinx ensue -.-;

Back to manslayer :D when Jane goes 
"oh I'll head to the kitchen alright." George should be glad she's not willing to stab him. Beause that's where the knives are. Just sayin

as for freehold... well I accidentally found a place by random name... that might be where a Proudstone might be from. *sip* `-`;




[21:46] <Eldrick> but really don't call places old ham without doddering method actors for rent or hire by the truckload.
[21:47] <Eldrick> "quick I need 10 scene chewers!" "here you go!"
[21:47] <Eldrick> england->shakespeare `-`b

this one... is... self... explanatiory... right?


[21:50] <Eldrick> [AuthorEld: No I'm not on anything... just trying to use my overflowing creative juices... that are building up because I've had various things on my leg -in the I can feel it getitoffofme- segmentum for a little while now... and they used MORE tape today than the last two weeks combined.]
[21:52] <Eldrick> [AuthorEld: If I ay what the device is... well all pictures of it in use are nightmare fuel. No really. this is nothing in comparison... but I'm not inflicting the images on people who in at least one case can't thing about needles without reacting. `-`;]
[21:54] <Eldrick> [AuthorEld: so just imagine I ave a tentacle wrapped around my leg... that my subconscious is rabidfanboy convinced is out to kill me `-`b]

[21:56] <Eldrick> [CTHULHU HAS YOU!!!] [No subconscious he doesn't] [we iz the deadz!] [no we ain't dead yet -.-;] [I CAN HEAR THE SONG OF THE DEEEEEEEEP] [there are pills for that I do not want to be subscribed to them. so can it.][IT BURNS US NASTY ELF ROPE]

[21:57] <Eldrick> and again I do not actually hear a voice. but when I think back to how a nightmare felt... boom. dragged unda da sea @.@
[21:58] <Eldrick> and again again... if I heard a voice at least i could think at it,"Bramford shut up. I'm playing Moon Patrol."
[21:59] <Eldrick> Bramford-by-depressiongultch. It is in Sussex. ?Obviously?

because everything comes back to england and the sea... and lovecraft. why not *sip*
